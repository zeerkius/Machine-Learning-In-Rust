This is essentially a pre-processing project where I will implement convolutions and kernels from scratch and test on a dataset to see how accurate my implementation works. This will be used in a diagnostic research project that will soon be available for publishing. Project PI - Md Shuvo  , mhshuvo@pvamu.edu

This project will use data from ALS Brain Bank. We are currently waiting on a Data Share Agreement from Oxford Faculty.
